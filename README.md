Part 1. 

The weatherperson has predicted rain tomorrow, but we don’t
trust her. Plus we have heard of this new thing called probability and we want to test it out. In recent years, it
has rained only 73 days each year (assume there are no leap years in our world such that a year is 365 days).
When it actually rains, the weatherperson correctly forecasts rain 70% of the time. When it doesn’t rain, she
incorrectly forecasts rain 30% of the time. What is the probability that it will rain tomorrow?

[Hint: It is useful to consider two binary random variables – whether it rains or not (R ∈ {0, 1}) and whether
or not the weatherperson forecasts rain (F ∈ {0, 1}). Start by listing all the probabilities the problem provides
– e.g. P(F=0|R=0), P(F=1|R=0),P(F=0|R=1), P(F=1|R=1), P(R=1), P(R=0). Then consider how to get
P(R=1 | F=1) – the probability that it will rain given that the weatherperson forecasted rain.]

Part 2. 

Consider the following system of equations:

2x<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub> + x<sub>3</sub> = 3,

4x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>3</sub> = 10,

2x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = −2.

(a) Write the system as a matrix equation of the form Ax = b.

(b) Solve for Ax = b by using the matrix inverse of A (You can use software to get the inverse matrix but be sure to cite your source).

Part 3. 

Define matrix B = bb<sup>T</sup>, where b ∈ R<sup>d×1</sup> is a column vector that is not all-zero. 

Show that for any vector x ∈ R<sup>d×1</sup>, x<sup>T</sup> Bx ≥ 0.

[Hint: Try to get x<sup>T</sup> Bx to look like the product of two identical scalars. Note that b
<sup>T</sup> x = (x<sup>T</sup>b)<sup>T</sup>, that a<sup>T</sup> = a for scalar value a, and that matrix multiplication is associative.]
